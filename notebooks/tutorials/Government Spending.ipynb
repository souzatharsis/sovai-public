A concatenation of agencyID, Referenced IDV Agency Identifier, PIID, AwardModificationAmendmentNumber, ParentAwardId, and Transaction Number, with a single underscore (\\'_\\') character inserted in between each. If a field is blank, it is recorded as \"-none-\". agencyID is an FPDS field that captures the Agency or SubTier Agency that submitted the transaction to FPDS (often distinct from the awarding agency). For contract IDV records, only agencyID, PIID, and AwardModificationAmendmentNumber are part of the unique key, even if additional fields in the key are present in the IDV record; the rest of the fields are recorded as \"-none-\" for unique key purposes. Example of ContractTransactionUniqueKey: 9700_-none-FA440706C0001_P00007-none-_0. |\\n|   1 | contract_award_unique_key       | Derived unique record key used by the Broker to identify the prime award. Note that this element is different from the AssistanceTransactionUniqueKey and the ContractTransactionUniqueKey in that it identifies the award, not a specific transaction within the award. For contract records, this element is a concatenation of PIID, agencyID, ParentAwardId, and Referenced IDV Agency Identifier. For financial assistance records, this element is a concatenation of FAIN, URI, and AwardingSubTierAgencyCode. In both cases a single underscore (\\'_\\') character is inserted in between each element value. And in both cases if an element value is blank then the values used is \"NONE\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\\n|   9 | federal_action_obligation       | Amount of Federal government’s obligation, de-obligation, or liability, in dollars, for an award transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\\n| 277 | last_modified_date              | The last modified date captures the change date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\\n| 284 | transaction_description         | Description of the transaction or award.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |'"
